Oetker Digital technical challenge


### Specification
We would expect the core exercise to take around 1.5 to 2 hours.  Attached you will find a design in a JPG file. The module should contain the following elements:

Tabs

Including JS functionality (please do not use jQueryUI, jQuery can be used)
Random tab selection on every page load
Lists

In the "Topics" tab, the number of topics after the headline should count up from zero to a random number of posts animated with a nice transition
In the second tab "Archives" please add several rows containing on the left a picture and on the right some random text
The solution should be responsive (please do not use bootstrap or any other CSS framework). Please use the folder structure below for your assets:

Solution

├──css

├──img

├──js

├──index.html

This means that you should be able to email me a “Solution” folder containing three subfolders (css, img, js) and an index.html file.

OPTIONAL:

A plus would be to use a modern frontend workflow (ex. Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, …)
Another plus would be if you use a javascript framework (ex. React, Vue.js, …)
